<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In this era of hectic and stressed life, we are here to present you a virtual fitness instructor which will help in exercise and yoga by providing correct poses. It goes without saying that yoga should be an ego-free playground. Practitioners should always feel free to come and move and flow according to their own unique needs and body types. However, this isnâ€™t always the case. <br><br>
My idea is to provide everyone their personal fitness guide which will help them in living a healthy life without making any extra efforts. It will help in learning and performing correct exercises and yoga effortlessly. <br><br>
Apart from this, it has many additional features. It will remind us to maintain regularity and will have a complete record of daily progress which will help in motivation. With the help of a calorie counter, it will tell us how many calories we burnt during our exercise period.
