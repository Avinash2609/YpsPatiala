         <h3> Fruit and vegetables: are you getting your 5 A Day?</h3>
          <p class="lead my-3">
            Fruit and vegetables are a good source of vitamins and minerals and fibre, and should make up just over a third of the food you eat each day.

            It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.
            
            There's evidence that people who eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and some cancers.
            
            Eating 5 portions is not as hard as it sounds.
            
            <br>A portion is:<br>
            
            <li>80g of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables</li>
            <li>30g of dried fruit – which should be kept to mealtimes</li>
            <li>150ml glass of fruit juice or smoothie – but do not have more than 1 portion a day as these drinks are sugary and can damage teeth</li>
            <br>Just 1 apple, banana, pear or similar-sized fruit is 1 portion each.
            
            A slice of pineapple or melon is also 1 portion, and 3 heaped tablespoons of vegetables is another portion.
            
            Adding a tablespoon of dried fruit, such as raisins, to your morning cereal is an easy way to get 1 portion.
            
            You could also swap your mid-morning biscuit for a banana, and add a side salad to your lunch. 
            
            In the evening, have a portion of vegetables with dinner and fresh fruit with plain, lower fat yoghurt for dessert to reach your 5 A Day.
